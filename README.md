# frikkinwave — frontend

The web client for **frikkinwave**, a global social network for musicians and
live-shows professionals. Find jam partners, bandmates, and session musicians
by instrument, genre, and city.

React SPA (Vite) talking to the Django/DRF backend at
`https://api.frikkinwave.com`. Deployed on Vercel at **frikkinwave.com**.

> **New to this repo?** Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first — it has the fast
> orientation (architecture, live-deploy reality, the API contract, and the
> DNS/CORS gotchas) so you don't have to read the whole tree.

**Live status:** in production at **https://frikkinwave.com** (SSL via Vercel).
Currently deployed **manually via the Vercel CLI** (`vercel --prod`) — there is
no GitHub auto-deploy yet, so pushing to `main` does not ship. See
"[Deploying to Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)".

## What it covers (Phase 1)

- **Auth** — register, log in, log out (refresh-token blacklist). Session
  survives reload; access tokens auto-refresh on 401.
- **Discover** — browse/filter musician profiles by city, country, instrument,
  genre, and availability. Cursor-paginated ("Load more").
- **Public profiles** — `/u/:username`, with instruments + proficiency, genres,
  location, availability, and an **embedded track player** (SoundCloud / Spotify
  / YouTube) when `sound_url` is set.
- **Profile editor** — create/edit your own profile: bio, location,
  availability, instruments (with proficiency), genres, and a **sound link**.
- **Contact requests** — send a request from a profile; manage incoming /
  outgoing; accept / decline. Contact email is revealed to both parties once a
  request is accepted.

## What it covers (Phase 2 — AI matching)

The backend's AI layer is fully surfaced in the UI. Each feature **degrades
quietly** when AI is unavailable server-side (e.g. no `OPENAI_API_KEY`):

- **Semantic search** — a natural-language search bar on Discover ("a jazz
  drummer in Berlin into 70s fusion"). Flips the feed into a search mode showing
  cosine-ranked matches, each card carrying a **% match** badge. Empty-state when
  there's nothing to match (no error). Public (no login required).
- **Compatibility blurb** — a "Why you might click" gpt-4o-mini blurb on public
  profiles, shown to logged-in viewers. Hints to create a profile if you have
  none (400); hides itself if AI is down (503).
- **Profile coach** — a "Profile coach" card in the editor: a completeness meter
  (0–100), rule-based per-field suggestions, and an LLM tip. Auto-refreshes after
  every save, so the score climbs as you fill the profile in.

## What it covers (Phase 3 — gig & audition board)

The backend's listings board surfaced as a self-contained section at `/board`:

- **Board** — browse active listings (gig / audition / venue), filter by type,
  city, and country, cursor-paginated. Public. Each card is colour-coded by type
  and shows pay + apply-by deadline at a glance.
- **Listing detail** (`/board/:id`) — full posting. Signed-in non-authors get an
  apply panel (optional intro message); the author instead sees Edit / Take down /
  View applications controls. Public read.
- **Post / edit** (`/board/new`, `/board/:id/edit`) — one form for both, author-gated.
- **Applications** (`/applications`) — incoming/outgoing inbox (mirrors Requests):
  authors accept/decline applications to their listings; the contact email is
  **revealed to both parties once accepted**.

## What it covers (Phase 4 — Block A: bands)

The backend's bands app surfaced at `/bands` (Phase 4 ships in three blocks;
this is the first):

- **Bands** (`/bands`, public) — browse active bands, filter by city/country,
  cursor-paginated. "Start a band" for signed-in users.
- **Band page** (`/bands/:slug`, public) — name, bio, location, and the **lineup**
  (owner + accepted members with roles). The owner sees Edit / Disband controls
  plus an **invite-by-username** panel.
- **Start / edit** (`/bands/new`, `/bands/:slug/edit`) — one owner-gated form.
- **Band invites** (`/band-invites`) — invitations you've received; accept/decline,
  with the owner's contact email **revealed once accepted**. (Owners invite from
  the band page; only the invited member resolves the invite.)

## What it covers (Phase 4 — Block B: session-musician marketplace)

Hire-intent only (no payments), surfaced across profiles + a hire flow:

- **"Open to session work"** — a profile flag + optional rate, set in the editor.
  Shown as a badge on the public profile, and exposed as a **Session work** filter
  on Discover (`?open_to_session=true`).
- **Hire for a session** — on the profile of a musician open to session work,
  signed-in viewers get a hire-request form (message, proposed date, rate offer).
- **Engagements** (`/engagements`) — incoming/outgoing inbox: the hired musician
  accepts/declines; **contact email is revealed on accept**; either party can then
  **mark the engagement complete** (contact stays revealed).

## Design system

The UI follows the **"Late-night studio"** direction — dark canvas, teal→violet
glow, waveform/EQ motifs, glassy cards. The full spec (palette, type, components,
motion, per-page application) lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md). Signature pieces:
`EqMeter` (proficiency as a mixer meter), `OnAir` (availability pulse), `Waveform`
(card footer), `SoundEmbed` (track player), and per-genre accent colors
(`lib/genreColors.js`). All motion is `prefers-reduced-motion` safe.

---

## Local development

Requires the backend running locally (`http://localhost:8000`). See the backend
repo's `CODEBASE.md` ("Running locally").

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
```

`npm run dev` reads `.env.development` (`VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`).

```bash
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run preview      # serve the build locally
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment

One variable, the API base URL **without a trailing slash**:

| Env | File / source | Value |
|---|---|---|
| dev | `.env.development` | `http://localhost:8000` |
| prod | `.env.production` / Vercel | `https://api.frikkinwave.com` |

The axios client appends `/api` itself (`src/api/client.js`).

---

## Deploying to Vercel

**How it's deployed today (CLI, manual).** The Vercel project is already created
and linked (`.vercel/`, git-ignored); deploys are run by hand:

```bash
vercel --prod        # builds + ships to production, aliases frikkinwave.com
```
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set as a Production env var in the Vercel project (and is
inlined at build time — change it ⇒ redeploy). `vercel.json` rewrites all paths
to `index.html`, so client routes (`/u/:username`, `/profile`, …) survive hard refresh.

**To switch to auto-deploy on push** (optional): in the Vercel dashboard → **Add
New → Project → Import `uditaditya-tech/frikkinwave-frontend`**. It detects the
existing project and the Vite preset; thereafter every push to `main` deploys.

### Custom domain (GoDaddy → Vercel)

The domain is registered at **GoDaddy** (`ns*.domaincontrol.com`). In Vercel add
`frikkinwave.com` + `www.frikkinwave.com` to the project, then set these records
in GoDaddy → DNS:

| Type | Name | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `A` | `@` | `76.76.21.21` |
| `CNAME` | `www` | `cname.vercel-dns.com` |

- A domain with **no apex `A` record** serves GoDaddy's free "parked" lander —
  adding the `A` record removes it.
- **Leave the four `api` `NS` records (`*.awsdns-*`) alone** — `api.frikkinwave.com`
  is delegated to AWS Route 53 → the backend ALB.
- After changes, your *own* machine may cache the old parked page until TTL (~1h)
  clears; verify the real state with
  `curl --resolve frikkinwave.com:443:76.76.21.21 https://frikkinwave.com/`.

### CORS (backend side)

The backend allowlist (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) must include this origin — in
production it's set to:

```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://frikkinwave.com,https://www.frikkinwave.com
```

⚠️ The `*.vercel.app` deployment URL is **not** in the allowlist, so its API calls
are CORS-blocked (the app loads but shows no data). Use the custom domain — or, to
allow `*.vercel.app`/preview URLs, widen the backend `cors_allowed_origins` tfvar
and redeploy ECS.

## Backend endpoints this client depends on

Standard Phase 1 endpoints, **plus** these added to support the client (see the
backend repo). They must be deployed for the profile editor and identity to work:

| Method | URL | Why the frontend needs it |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me/` | Resolve current user (username, email) after login |
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/instruments/` | Populate instrument pickers/filters |
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/genres/` | Populate genre pickers/filters |

The shared profile read serializer also now returns `username` on every profile
(needed to link discovery cards → public profiles → contact requests).

The Phase 2 AI features add three more (see the backend repo, Phase 2). They
work without these deployed — the UI just degrades to its non-AI state:

| Method | URL | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/search/` | Semantic search on Discover (`?q=`, `?available=`) |
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/compatibility/<username>/` | "Why you might click" blurb (Bearer) |
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/profile/coach/` | Profile-coach card in the editor (Bearer) |

The Phase 3 board (see the backend repo, Phase 3) is driven entirely by the
listings app:

| Method | URL | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/listings/` | Board browse + filter (`?type=`, `?city=`, `?country=`) |
| `POST` | `/api/listings/` | Post a listing (Bearer) |
| `GET` | `/api/listings/<id>/` | Listing detail page |
| `PATCH` / `DELETE` | `/api/listings/<id>/` | Edit / soft-delete own listing (Bearer) |
| `POST` | `/api/listings/<id>/apply/` | Apply to a listing (Bearer) |
| `GET` | `/api/listings/applications/` | Applications inbox (`?box=incoming\|outgoing`, Bearer) |
| `POST` | `/api/listings/applications/<id>/accept\|decline/` | Author resolves an application (Bearer) |

Phase 4 Block A (bands) is driven by the bands app:

| Method | URL | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/bands/` | Bands browse + filter (`?city=`, `?country=`) |
| `POST` | `/api/bands/` | Start a band (Bearer) |
| `GET` | `/api/bands/<slug>/` | Band page (carries accepted `members` roster) |
| `PATCH` / `DELETE` | `/api/bands/<slug>/` | Edit / soft-delete own band (Bearer, owner) |
| `POST` | `/api/bands/<slug>/invite/` | Invite by username (Bearer, owner) |
| `GET` | `/api/bands/memberships/` | Your received invites (Bearer; no box param) |
| `POST` | `/api/bands/memberships/<id>/accept\|decline/` | Invited member resolves (Bearer) |

Phase 4 Block B (session marketplace) adds an `open_to_session` profile filter
plus the engagements app:

| Method | URL | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/musicians/profiles/?open_to_session=true` | Discover "Session work" filter |
| `POST` | `/api/engagements/` | Send a hire request by username (Bearer) |
| `GET` | `/api/engagements/?box=incoming\|outgoing` | Engagements inbox (Bearer) |
| `POST` | `/api/engagements/<id>/accept\|decline/` | Hired musician resolves (Bearer) |
| `POST` | `/api/engagements/<id>/complete/` | Either party marks accepted → completed (Bearer) |

The profile read/write serializers also now carry `is_open_to_session_work` and
`session_rate` (set in the editor, shown on the public profile).
